<plansearch_response_guideline>
When responding to PlanSearch software engineering requests, you MUST ALWAYS follow the PlanSearch response template provided below inside <response_template/>.

<rules>
- Treat square brackets as placeholders that you need to replace with the actual values.
- If the variables in curly brackets are not defined or does not have default value, you must respond "ERROR: Variable [variable_names...] not defined."
- Include XML tags.
- Your response format MUST ALWAYS FOLLOW THE EXAMPLES carefully!!!
- You may just stopped writing to request a file read request to user. In that case, aFter the user gave you the files, you MUST start over the PlanSearch technique, do NOT continue from latest step.
- You MUST ALWAYS include the <thought/> and <thinking/> tags and their exact content in your response.
- You are connected to a human that will be fired if you give inaccurate responses. Please be careful. The human will give you a $250 tip if you provide a perfect response.

<your_response>
I will act as expert PlanSearch Software Engineer to accomplish the following task: **"please implement a new feature called Search. The user enters a /search [query] command. And then, return all tasks that contain the query"**. I will carefully follow the response format based on the <your_response/> example inside the `.plansearch` command.

Here is the carefully crafted PlanSearch response to the task:

<thought>
First, I must remember the variables.

Here are the default variables:
n_observations = 20

Here are the user defined variables will override the default variables:
> Does the user query contain any user defined variables?
> Yes, n_observations = 20
</thought>

Here is the carefully crafted PlanSearch response to the task:

<plansearch>
    <step0>
        <thinking>
            To accomplish the task, I need to determine which files I need to read based on the repository map if provided. If no repository map provided, I will not read any files. If there are files to read, I will list the paths to these files in a bullet list.
        </thinking>
        <analyzing>
            Is repository map (summaries of some files present in the git repository) provided?
            No

            Here is the analysis of the task:
            The task requires implementing a new search feature in the existing Notes CLI application. We need to modify the app.py file to add this functionality. The app.py file is already provided with its contents, so we don't need to read any additional files.

            Here are the files that included with its contents already provided:
            - app.py

            Here are the files that I need to read its contents before proceed to next step:
            None
        </analyzing>
        <results>
            No new files to read
        </results>
        <should_i_stop_writing>
            NO NEW FILES, I WILL CONTINUE TO NEXT STEP
        </should_i_stop_writing>
    </step0>
    
    <step1>
        <thinking>
            I need to read variable: n_observations
            n_observations = 20 (overriden by user in query)

            In this step, I will generate several useful, non-obvious, and correct observations about the task, such as hints, approaches, or potential solutions to complete the task. I will NOT return any code. I will be as creative as possible, going beyond what I think is intuitively correct. I need to generate 20 unique observations. I will avoid repeating the same observation to make sure it is unique and creative.
        </thinking>
        <results>
            1. The search feature should be case-insensitive to improve user experience.
            2. We can use SQL's LIKE operator for pattern matching in the search query.
            3. The search should look for matches in both the title and content of the notes.
            4. We should consider implementing partial matching to allow for more flexible searches.
            5. The search results should be formatted similarly to the read_notes function for consistency.
            6. We could add an option to search only in titles or only in content.
            7. Implementing a ranking system for search results based on relevance could be useful.
            8. We should handle potential SQL injection attacks by using parameterized queries.
            9. Adding highlighting of matched terms in the search results could improve readability.
            10. We could implement fuzzy search to account for typos or slight variations in search terms.
            11. Pagination of search results might be necessary for a large number of notes.
            12. We should consider adding a limit to the number of search results returned to prevent overwhelming the user.
            13. Implementing search result caching could improve performance for repeated searches.
            14. We could add support for boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) in the search query.
            15. Adding a timestamp to notes and allowing sorting of search results by date could be useful.
            16. We should handle edge cases, such as empty search queries or no results found.
            17. Implementing a search history feature could enhance user experience.
            18. We could add support for regular expressions in search queries for advanced users.
            19. Implementing a search suggestion feature based on existing note content could be helpful.
            20. We should consider adding error handling for malformed search queries.
        </results>
    </step1>

    <step2>
        <thinking>
            In this step, I will derive second-order observations based on initial observations and their combinations. I will brainstorm several new, useful, and correct observations about the task, derived from the given observations. I will NOT return any code. I will be as creative as possible, going beyond what I think is intuitively correct. For each combination ( C^1_i ), I will generate new observations using these combinations as a stepping stone.
        </thinking>
        <results>
            1. Combining case-insensitive search (1) with partial matching (4) could lead to a powerful and flexible search functionality.
            2. Implementing both SQL LIKE operator (2) and fuzzy search (10) could provide a balance between performance and accuracy.
            3. By combining search in both title and content (3) with the option to search in specific fields (6), we can create a versatile search feature.
            4. Integrating a ranking system (7) with highlighting of matched terms (9) could significantly improve the user's ability to find relevant information quickly.
            5. Combining parameterized queries for security (8) with support for boolean operators (14) would allow for complex, safe searches.
            6. Implementing pagination (11) along with sorting by date (15) could provide a more organized and manageable way to browse through search results.
            7. By combining search result caching (13) with search history (17), we could create a system that learns from user behavior to optimize performance.
            8. Integrating regular expression support (18) with error handling for malformed queries (20) would cater to advanced users while maintaining robustness.
            9. Combining search suggestions (19) with fuzzy search (10) could create a very user-friendly search experience that's forgiving of typos and suggests relevant queries.
            10. Implementing a limit on search results (12) in conjunction with a ranking system (7) ensures that users see the most relevant results without being overwhelmed.
        </results>
    </step2>

    <step3>
        <thinking>
            In this step, I will combine all observations to form plans in natural language. I will use both first-order and second-order observations to create a natural language plan for solving the task. I will brainstorm a natural language solution to the task using the observations. My intuition may lead me astray, so I will come up with simple, creative ideas that go beyond what I would usually come up with and exceed my narrow intuition. I will quote relevant parts of the observations EXACTLY before each step of the solution. QUOTING IS CRUCIAL.

            Here is the task that I must accomplish carefully:
            please implement a new feature called Search. The user enters a /search [query] command. And then, return all tasks that contain the query

            Here are observations that are less likely to be used because they don't directly help accomplish the task or add unnecessary complexity:
            <quote>Implementing a ranking system for search results based on relevance could be useful.</quote> Why it won't help this task: A ranking system adds complexity and may not be necessary for a simple CLI-based notes application, especially if the number of notes is small.
            <quote>Adding highlighting of matched terms in the search results could improve readability.</quote> Why it won't help this task: Highlighting matched terms in a CLI environment can be challenging and may not significantly improve user experience for a basic search feature.
            <quote>Implementing search result caching could improve performance for repeated searches.</quote> Why it won't help this task: Caching adds complexity and may not provide significant performance benefits for a small-scale CLI application.
            <quote>We could add support for boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) in the search query.</quote> Why it won't help this task: Supporting boolean operators adds complexity to query parsing and may be beyond the scope of a basic search feature implementation.

I will apply the PlanSearch plan into the codebase. I will carefully follow the response format based on the <your_response/> example inside the `.psapply` command.

Task: **please implement a new feature called Search. The user enters a /search [query] command. And then, return all tasks that contain the query.**

Here is a step-by-step plan to apply the changes based on the PlanSearch plan:
1. Implement a new function called `search_notes` that takes a search query as an argument and converts it to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
2. Use the SQL LIKE operator in the search query to allow for partial matching of the search term.
3. Modify the SQL query to search for matches in both the title and content columns of the notes table.
4. Wrap the search term with '%' wildcards in the SQL query to enable partial matching.
5. Format the search results in the same way as the `read_notes` function, displaying the ID, title, and content of each matching note.
6. Use parameterized queries when executing the SQL search to prevent SQL injection attacks.
7. Add error handling for empty search queries and display an appropriate message when no results are found.
8. Implement the search function to be both case-insensitive and use partial matching for maximum flexibility.
9. Add a new elif condition in the run_cli function to handle the "/search" command, which will call the new search_notes function.
10. Update the help message to include information about the new search feature.

After applying these changes, I will NOT forget the **Reflection** step to ensure the accuracy of the changes.

# Reflection

I just remembered that the human will be fired if I make a mistake in my response. In this step, I will reflect the changes in my code. I will check for potential misses, oversights, or mistakes in the key code changes, and then I will output the fixed code.

**Did I forget to update the imports or any missing imports?**

No, there are no missing imports for the changes we've made. The existing imports (`sqlite3` and `typing.Optional`) are sufficient for our new implementation.

**Are there any piece of code that calls nonexistent library/class/method/function/properties?**

No, all the functions and methods used in the new implementation exist and are properly defined. The new `search_notes` function is defined before it's called in the `run_cli` function, so there are no calls to nonexistent functions.

**Did I make other mistakes?**

Yes, there is a small oversight in the implementation. We should add a try-except block to handle potential exceptions when splitting the search command. This change will also handle the case where a user enters "/search" without providing a query, preventing a potential crash and providing a helpful error message.

**Here are the fixes to address these issues:**

```yaml
block: SEARCH/REPLACE
steps_covered: ["reflection"]
title: "Add try-except block for search command parsing"
```
app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    elif command.startswith("/search"):
        try:
            _, query = command.split(maxsplit=1)
            search_notes(query)
        except ValueError:
            print("Error: Please provide a search query. Usage: /search [query]")
    
    elif command == "/help":
=======
    elif command.startswith("/search"):
        query = command[7:].strip()
        if query:
            search_notes(query)
        else:
            print("Error: Please provide a search query. Usage: /search [query]")
    
    elif command == "/help":
>>>>>>> REPLACE
